Hi! Welcome to my website.

Currenlty I am Research Scientist in Amazon Alexa NLU working on NLU models for non-English languages. Previoulsy, I was a Sr Applied AI/ML Assoc. in JPMorganChase & Co. my work has been focussed on applications of AI in Controls and Compliance in trading. 
Previously, I had pursued my Ph.D. in Operations Research. 

Beyond scientific research and building such application, I have a keen interest in Analytic Philosophy. Recently, I have taken to writing. Some of it is available to read at [my medium page](https://medium.com/@abhinavkhr30) and in my newsletter on [my substack](https://abhinavkhare.substack.com/).
